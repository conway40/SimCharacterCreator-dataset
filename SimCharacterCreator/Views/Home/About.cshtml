<p>
    The application will be a Sims character creator/generator. Users will be able to view, edit, and delete characters that are already created, make their own characters, and generate character traits for their character. A user might want to use this application because when playing The Sims, many players fall into a pattern of making similar characters with the same traits. This app can introduce new ways of playing their game because they are able to randomize traits and aspirations, or because they can find Sims that other people have made.
